      <p>
        Maintaining a system is equally important as Web Application
        Development. It keeps solutions healthy to deal with changing technology
        and business environment. Generally, IT service providers suggest their
        clients to go for software maintenance services for the consistent and
        enhanced performance of the system. As per Mr. Robert Glass, writer of
        the ‘Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering’, when it comes to
        software, 60% costing is for maintenance. Even from total software
        maintenance cost, 60% is for solution enhancement.

      <p>
        IT is one of the most updated industry domains. It introduces technical
        advancements almost every day that improve solution efficiency to
        streamline business operations. Under maintenance management, the system
        is updated with the latest technologies on a regular basis and runs
        seamlessly with high-end efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes system maintenance involves improvements in the existing
        solution and at times there are requirements of new software development
        as per the changing market needs.

      <h2>What is Software Maintenance?</h2>
      <p>
        It is a very broad activity that takes place once the operation is done.
        Software evolution and maintenance optimizes the software performance by
        reducing errors, eliminating useless development, and applying advanced
        development. Solution development can take 1-2 years to build a system,
        while software maintenance management can be an ongoing activity for
        15-20 years.

      <h2>Types of Software Maintenance Services Categories: </h2>
      <p>
        <span>1. Adaptive Maintenance –</span> Modifications in the system to
        keep it compatible with changing business and technical environment.
        This type of software maintenance concentrate on software
        infrastructure. To retain continuity with the software, adaptive
        maintenance are made in response to new operating systems, hardware, and
        platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span>2. Perfective Maintenance –</span> Fine tuning of all elements,
        functionalities and abilities to improve system operations and
        perfectness. The software’s accessibility and usability are solved by
        perfective software maintenance. Perfective maintenance includes
        altering current software functionality by improving, removing, or
        inserting new features or functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>3. Corrective Maintenance –</span> Detecting errors in the
        existing solution and correcting them to make it works more efficiently.
        This type of software maintenance aims to eliminate and fix bugs or
        defects in the software. Corrective software maintenance is often done
        in the form of small updates frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>4. Preventive Maintenance –</span> Preventive software maintenance
        services help in preventing the system from any upcoming
        vulnerabilities. Preventive maintenance means improvements to the
        software, which is done to secure the software for the future. This
        maintenance is carried out to prevent the product from any potential
        software alteration. Preventive maintenance also makes it easier to
        scale or maintain your code and handle your legacy system.
