        Advertising is always present, though people may not be aware of it. In
        today’s world, advertising uses every possible media to get its message
        through. It does this via television, print (newspapers, magazines,
        journals etc), radio, press, internet, direct selling, hoardings,
        mailers, contests, sponsorships, posters, clothes, events, colours,
        sounds, visuals and even people (endorsements).

        The advertising industry is made of companies that advertise, agencies
        that create the advertisements, media that carries the ads, and a host
        of people like copy editors, visualizers, brand managers, researchers,
        creative heads and designers who take it the last mile to the customer
        or receiver. A company that needs to advertise itself and/or its
        products hires an advertising agency. The company briefs the agency on
        the brand, its imagery, the ideals and values behind it, the target
        segments and so on. The agencies convert the ideas and concepts to
        create the visuals, text, layouts and themes to communicate with the
        user. After approval from the client, the ads go on air, as per the
        bookings done by the agency’s media buying unit.
